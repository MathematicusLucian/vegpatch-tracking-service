# vegpatch-tracking-service

Exploring use of JavaScript ((Johnny-Five) rather than Python to operate a PI. This little app is to monitor the health of a garden plant, and ensure it is receives sufficient water. The app collects statuses from sensors, and saves them to a database (could be saved to Pi; but will save to cloud, to allow mobile access while away from home.)
